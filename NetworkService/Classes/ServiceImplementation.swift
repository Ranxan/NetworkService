/*  These are the base implementations for using NetworkService library. 
    Response models to be received by the client must be defined with these base models.
    
    Response from the API is received in the following format:
    {
        status : {}
        body : {} /*Single object is received as a body itself and array of objects are received with further pagination information inside the body.*/
    }
    
    Each data model extends from BaseModel which is a Mappable type from ObjectMapper library.
    Status is of type ServiceResponseStatus, which is a custom type that incorporates fields and the fields hold response status from the service API.

    Hence, major implementation of NetworkService component includes:
    
    - BaseModel (for response data models)
    - ServiceResponseStatus (for response status)
    - BaseResponse (for response as a whole, wrapping both response data model and status)
